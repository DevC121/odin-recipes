        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Potato Salad, a dish consisting of boiled potatoes, usually containing a dressing and variety of numerous ingreidents such as boiled eggs and raw vegetables.
            This dish is widely believed to have originated from Germany, while spreading largely throughout Europe, then America, and lastly Asia. Americans usually serve
            this recipe cold or at room temperature, South-Germans when warm or room temperature (typically includes bacon), North-Germans and Asians same as Americans, but Asian dishes are usually 
            sweeter and eggier in flavor. Potato Salad isn't a complicated recipe, and is often a side dish to complement the main course. Whether its served cold, warm, or room temperature,
            this dish is easily one of my favorites, and today we'll go over the ingredients and how to go about making it.
